# ECB Speech Sentiment VAR
This repository contains the code and processed data for analyzing European Central Bank communication sentiment and its impact on macroeconomic variables using Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling.

# About
This project examines how ECB communication sentiment functions as a monetary policy transmission mechanism across different presidential regimes (Duisenberg, Trichet, Draghi, Lagarde). Using transformer-based natural language processing on 720 speeches, we demonstrate how sentiment impacts key economic indicators with heterogeneous effects.
